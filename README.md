# CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle
This repository serves as an archive of my work for SNHU's CS250 course, "Software Development Lifecycle."
The aim of this course was to introduce students, such as myself, to the Agile development methodology.
To do this, I performed roleplaying activities and created journals from the perspectives of the various
different team members of an Agile development group: the product owner, the scrum master, a developer,
and a tester.

Throughout this course, I also worked to create an application in Java, using Eclipse. The goal was to 
apply Agile methodologies to develop an interactive travel booking application/website for the fictional
SNHU Travel company. The coursework had me (roleplay) communicate with representatives from SNHU Travel
to establish and refine the vision for the travel booking project, and incorporate desired changes as the
vision evolved over time.

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Determining user needs should be done by having in-depth conversations with the stakeholders of the comissioned project.
In these discussions, the Product Owner should strive to glean as much detail about what the user wants the product to
be able to do and how they like to go about doing the tasks they perform. Understanding the user's workflow will allow
the development team to create a better product, that truly meets the users needs.

Using the information gained from these discussions, the Product Owner will come up with "user stories." These are short
descriptions of what the user would like to do with the product. In many cases, there are multiple different types of user
that may end up using the product, so it's important to take everyone into account. User stories should depict a use case
using the following general template: "As a {user role here}, I would like to be able to {action to be performed here},
so that I can {purpose or end goal of action here}." This template helps the development team put themselves in the shoes
of the potential end user and imagine what they would want from the program.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Up until now, I had mostly developed programs by just diving straight into the code. I would carry out marathon dev sessions
and try to get at least a rudimentary version of the final program running in a single programming binge.
While I already more or less practiced the iterative programming style indemic to Agile development methods, I think that
moving forward I will definitely try to incorporate the agile practices of planning sprints instead of huge marathons, and
iteratively creating modules, rather than trying to get a rough version of the program running all in one go.

This will definitely help to make the process of creating an application much less daunting.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means knowing when to step it up and when to ask for help.
On the one hand, as a member of a development team, it is important to understand that you cannot do it all by
yourself. You have your role to play and there may be times where you're asked to take on extra responsibilities
to help struggling teammates, but you cannot hope to accomplish the development cycle all on your own. Your first
and primary responsibility is to perform the tasks designated to your role. If however, you have those tasks well in
hand and you notice other members of the development team are struggling, you should remember that agile frowns upon
having team members who are overly-specialized. You should be willing and able to jump in and assist when the situation
calls for it, and unafraid to ask for help from others when you're feeling overwhelmed. It takes a village.
