# CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle
This repository serves as an archive of my work for SNHU's CS250 course, "Software Development Lifecycle."
The aim of this course was to introduce students, such as myself, to the Agile development methodology.
To do this, I performed roleplaying activities and created journals from the perspectives of the various
different team members of an Agile development group: the product owner, the scrum master, a developer,
and a tester.

Throughout this course, I also worked to create an application in Java, using Eclipse. The goal was to 
apply Agile methodologies to develop an interactive travel booking application/website for the fictional
SNHU Travel company. The coursework had me (roleplay) communicate with representatives from SNHU Travel
to establish and refine the vision for the travel booking project, and incorporate desired changes as the
vision evolved over time.
